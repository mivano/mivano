### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Microsoft .NET developer/consultant/architect/manager with a focus on web applications and cloud systems, but also working on backend applications and more complex integrations. Being a certified Scrum Master I additionally started to coach and help multiple scrum teams but moved my focus more to building and managing product and technology teams and had the CTO role in previous organizations. 

My heart is with the technique although I'm also capable of managing different teams with professionals over the last couple of years. Being involved with the hiring process and coaching of the people while also setting the IT vision and executing on the strategies. I m interested in team topologies and improving the way people work together to great working software in an agile way.
